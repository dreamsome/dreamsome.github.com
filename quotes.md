Ultimately it comes down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done, and try to bring these things to what you are doing. Picasso had a saying "good artists copy, great artist steal". We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas. I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians, who also happend to be best computer scientists in the world. But if hadn't been computer science, these people would have all been doing amazing things in other fields.
